☕ Coffee Orders Analytics Project
Business Intelligence and Consumer Insight using Excel + Data Models

🧩 Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee sales data to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales trends. Using detailed order data across multiple dimensions (customer, product, geography), we built an interactive dashboard to support decisions around product strategy, pricing, and loyalty engagement.

📄 Data Summary
The dataset includes multi-sheet transactional data covering:

Table	Description
orders	Individual coffee orders with customer & product info
customers	Customer profiles including geography and loyalty
products	Product catalog with pricing and profit data

Key columns in the orders table include:

Order ID, Order Date

Customer ID, Country

Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size

Unit Price, Sales, Profit
